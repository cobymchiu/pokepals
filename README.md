## Overview
The popular Pokemon franchise has seen great success from its games. This success has manifested itself in the countless fan-made spinoffs of the series,
and we decided that our web development project would be a game creating a simple and social experience. <br>

After logging in, the user is able to click on a map to catch a Pokemon of their own. Different terrains on the map contain different types of Pokemon to be caught. 
Caught Pokemon are visible on the user's profile and can be made public by putting them on a team using the Dashboard. 
Players can also friend each other and view others' teams.
